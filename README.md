## Week 5 Theme switch(partial)
> Implemented a theme switching feature that allows users to toggle between light and dark modes.
The feature uses a central theme state to dynamically update UI colors throughout the app.
User preferences can be persisted locally so that the selected theme is remembered across sessions.
